# DSMP_MultiArtcVehicle_HANcoder

This Github is made as a part of a minor project at the HAN university of applied siences.
it shows the implmentation of a TTCAN system wich is developed to showcase a proof of concept of a multi articulated vehicle reverse assist.


# HANcoder
HANcoder STM32 Target is part of the open model based development (openMBD)
suite created by HAN Automotive Research.
HANcoder is a family of real-time code generation targets for MATLAB Simulink(R).
HANcoder supports both automotive grade series production controllers as well
as some low-cost development boards. The support for low-cost controllers as
well as production grade controllers provide users a unique possibility to
start desktop/laboratory prototyping with low-cost controllers and step up to
production grade prototypes as well as series production solutions with little
effort, thanks to the compatible HANcoder libraries for supported controllers.
HANcoder STM32 Target supports three low-cost STM32 based boards from Olimex.
